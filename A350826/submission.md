# OEIS submission draft — prime sextuplet counts (A350826, A063501)

Draft of 2026-10-01, updated 2026-10-03 with the state of the OEIS. Everything below has been computed or
checked with the tools in this directory (`a350826.c`, `cuda/a350826_cuda.cu`, `verify_a350826.py`,
`verify/reverify_oeis.py`); see README.md for methods and run logs (`runs/`).

## Status on the OEIS (checked 2026-10-03 17:50 PDT)

* **A063501 — done.** Jeff's edit (#26, Oct 02 2026 22:05 EDT, proposed as #27) was reviewed by Michel
  Marcus (#28) and approved by Hugo Pfoertner (#29, Oct 03 2026 02:00 EDT). Live now: data through
  a(20) = 209359671771, the comment about counting by the largest member, the fixed link to Luhn's
  `PI_06.php`, keyword `hard`, and the two EXTENSIONS lines. Not included (optional follow-up, section 2):
  the FORMULA line and the cross-references to A343636 and A350826.
* **A350826 — still to do.** Unchanged since #24 (Jan 21 2022), data a(1..17), dead `PI_06.html` link, no
  pending draft. Section 1 is the edit to submit.
* **Related entries — unchanged** since before this work: A022008 (#91, Sep 16 2026), A343636 (#18, Jul 2021),
  A200503 (#75, Jul 02 2026), A200504 (#26, Nov 2025), A233426 (#13, Nov 2025), A271000 (#34, Jun 2026),
  A350825/A350827/A350828 (Apr 2022), A033874 (#49, Feb 2025).
* **Luhn's table** (`PI_06.php`) — unchanged since Sep 30: still pi_6(2^64) = 48629687343 and no
  pi_6(10^20).

## 1. A350826 — Number of prime sextuplets with n-digit initial term (to submit)

Current entry: #24, Jan 21 2022, data a(1..17), keywords `nonn,base,more,hard`.

### DATA (append three terms)

```
1,1,0,0,3,0,13,64,235,1296,7013,41782,253420,1607418,10520883,70785653,488096844,3439443854,24711327817,180637585474
```

These are exactly the first differences of the updated A063501 from n = 18 on:
4010758480 − 571314626 = 3439443854, 28722086297 − 4010758480 = 24711327817,
209359671771 − 28722086297 = 180637585474.

### COMMENTS — replace the second comment

Current:

> For n = 1 and n = 2 (see Example), the last member of the sextuplet has one digit more than
> the initial member (so the count would be 0 for these two, if all terms of the sextuplet had to
> have the same length). As far as we know, for all n > 2, all members of the sextuplets have the
> same length. A sufficient condition for this is that A033874(n) > 16.

Proposed:

```
For n = 1 and n = 2 (see Example), the last member of the sextuplet has one digit more than the initial member (so the count would be 0 for these two, if all terms of the sextuplet had to have the same length). For 3 <= n <= 24, all members of each sextuplet have the same length: no initial member p satisfies 10^n - 16 <= p < 10^n. A sufficient condition for this is A033874(n) > 16, which fails for n = 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20; for those n it was checked directly. Hence a(n) = A063501(n) - A063501(n-1) for 4 <= n <= 24.
```

(Checked with `a350826 count 10^n-16 10^n` for n = 3..24, `verify/reverify_oeis.txt`.)

### Optional comment (rigour of the counting)

```
A base-2 strong probable-prime test of the six members is not sufficient to count prime sextuplets: there are 5 numbers p in (10^17, 10^18), 3 in (10^18, 10^19) and 15 in (10^19, 10^20) for which p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16 are all base-2 strong probable primes but one of them is composite (a base-2 strong pseudoprime), e.g., p = 156502671571374757 with p+4 = 212630861*736029901.
```

The cases below 10^19 (all re-checked with Python's own primality test and Pollard rho; the 15 cases in
(10^19, 10^20) are listed in the README):

| p | composite member |
|---|---|
| 156502671571374757 | p+4 = 212630861 · 736029901 |
| 174519900169098217 | p = 79150597 · 2204909461 |
| 273314385115345027 | p+10 = 426860153 · 640290229 |
| 483757682409253657 | p+6 = 169691191 · 2850811993 |
| 532522504106799457 | p+16 = 161832109 · 3290586197 |
| 1157159728167006787 | p+6 = 563142103 · 2054827231 |
| 4211906013907595737 | p+4 = 1510446653 · 2788516897 |
| 6526567117896650257 | p+16 = 154618367 · 42210813919 |

### Optional FORMULA (asymptotic, conjectural)

```
Conjecture (Hardy-Littlewood): a(n) ~ C_6 * Integral_{10^(n-1)..10^n} dt/log(t)^6, C_6 = 17.29861... . For n = 17..20 the integral differs from a(n) by less than 5*10^-5 a(n) (2*10^-6 for n = 20); it gives a(21) ~ 1.34117*10^12.
```

(C_6 = prod over primes q of (1 - w(q)/q)/(1 - 1/q)^6 with w(q) the number of residues of
{0,4,6,10,12,16} mod q; computed over q < 3*10^6 plus the tail correction.)

### LINKS

Fix the dead link, as in A063501:

```
Norman Luhn, <a href="https://www.pzktupel.de/counting/PI_06.php">PI_6(10^n)</a>
```

Optional, only if the programs are published somewhere public:

```
Jeff Sponaugle, <a href="...">C and CUDA programs for counting prime sextuplets</a>
```

### CROSSREFS (add)

```
Cf. A350825 (5-tuples), A350827 (septuplets), A350828 (octuplets).
```

(A063501 and A343636 are already cross-referenced.)

### EXTENSIONS (add)

Same wording as the approved A063501 edit:

```
a(18)-a(19) from Karl Desfontaines (May 2026, see Luhn's table), independently confirmed by _Jeff Sponaugle_, Oct 01 2026
a(20) from _Jeff Sponaugle_, Oct 02 2026
```

Keyword `more` stays.

### Notes to the editors (paste into the discussion box)

Short version, in the style of the A063501 note that was accepted:

```
3 new terms: a(18)-a(19) agree with Karl Desfontaines's counts in Luhn's table, a(20) is new; they are the first differences of A063501(17..20), which was just extended (#29). The comment on members of different length is now checked for 3 <= n <= 24, and the dead link to Luhn's table is fixed.
```

Longer version, if the editors ask how the terms were computed:

```
a(18)-a(20) were computed with C and CUDA programs: candidates p are restricted to the 1516640125 residue classes modulo 2*3*5*...*37 that are admissible for the pattern (0,4,6,10,12,16); each class is sieved as an arithmetic progression with all primes up to 2^16; every member of every survivor gets a base-2 strong probable-prime test, and every member of every candidate that passes all six gets a strong Lucas test (BPSW, which has no counterexample below 2^64). Runs: a(18) 30.5 min and a(19) 4.0 h on one NVIDIA GB10 (DGX Spark), a(20) 60 GPU-hours on two. Checks: the programs reproduce a(1)..a(17); an independent Python program (numpy sieve, Python's own Miller-Rabin with the first 13 prime bases) agrees in count and checksum on 2*10^12-wide windows near 10^15, 10^17, 10^18, 10^19, 2^64, 10^20 and 10^22; the CPU and GPU programs give identical per-chunk counts and checksums; the [10^19, 2^64) part of the a(20) range was recounted with the machines swapped (identical per-chunk results), and 100 random chunks of the whole range were recomputed by the CPU program with identical results. The Lucas test matters: 5 (in a(18)), 3 (in a(19)) and 15 (in a(20)) candidates pass the base-2 test in all six members but contain a base-2 strong pseudoprime.
```

%C A063501 A sextuplet (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16) is counted when its largest member p+16 is at most 10^n; thus a(1) = 0 although p = 7 < 10.

```

Optional follow-up (not in the approved edit; could go in after the A350826 edit):

```
FORMULA:    a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} A350826(k) for 3 <= n <= 24 (no prime sextuplet has members on both sides of 10^n for these n).
CROSSREFS:  Cf. A343636, A350826.

## 3. a(20) — result and verification

`a350826_cuda count 1e19 1e20 -b 2^64,2e19,3e19,2^65,4e19,5e19,6e19,7e19,2^66,8e19,9e19` (wheel 37,

`combine_a20.py` (`runs/a20_combined.txt`): every chunk exactly once, the 10 chunks computed by both GPUs
have identical lines, candidates − count = 15 pseudo-sextuplets.

pi_6 at the bin boundaries (cumulative from pi_6(10^19) = 28722086297):

| x | sextuplets in [previous, x) | pi_6(x) |

| 10^20 | 18258580717 | 209359671771 |

**Discrepancy at 2^64.** Luhn's table lists pi_6(2^64) = 48629687343 (Desfontaines, Jul 2026); we get
48629688861, i.e. 1518 more sextuplets in [10^19, 2^64). Checks on our side:

* a full recount of [10^19, 2^64) on both GPUs with the halves swapped between the machines reproduced
  every chunk exactly (92569 of 92569 chunk lines identical, total 19907602564);
* a third computation of the range with 131 bins (the table below) gave the same total and the same total
  in every chunk;
* the CPU program (independent marking code and primality tests) recomputed 40 random chunks of
  [10^19, 2^64), and 100 random chunks of the whole a(20) range (crosswise between the machines): no mismatch;
* every counted sextuplet passed BPSW in all six members (no BPSW pseudoprime exists below 2^64), so our
  count cannot contain composites; the sieve only removes candidates; the same programs reproduce
  pi_6(10^18) and pi_6(10^19) of Desfontaines exactly;
* the 1518th sextuplet below 2^64 lies 6.82e11 below it (no natural cut-off there: [2^64 − 2^39, 2^64)
  holds 1211 sextuplets, [2^64 − 2^40, 2^64) holds 2453), so the difference is not simply a missing top
  segment of power-of-two size.

Our value therefore looks right; Jeff is contacting Norman Luhn (it does not affect any OEIS term).
For locating the difference, `runs/pi6_table_1e19_2p64.txt` (and `.md`) lists pi_6(x) at 131 points of
[10^19, 2^64]: every 10^17, every multiple of 2^58, and 2^64 − 2^j (j = 40..56). Luhn's value lies
between our pi_6(2^64 − 2^40) = 48629686408 and pi_6(2^64) = 48629688861.

## 4. Re-verified data (for the notes to the editors; no edits needed)

| sequence | what was checked | result |
|---|---|---|
| A350826 | all 17 terms a(1..17) (GPU tool; the CPU tool and the Python program for a(1..14) and a(1..10)), identical checksums wherever two programs ran | agree |
| A063501 | a(1..17) via the partial sums of A350826 and the straddling check | agree |
| Luhn PI_06 table | pi_6(10^18) = 4010758480, pi_6(10^19) = 28722086297 (Desfontaines, May 2026) | confirmed |

## 5. Possible further submissions (not ready yet)

* **New sequence: number of prime sextuplets below 2^n** (no such entry exists; searched
  "number of prime sextuplets", "sextuplets 2^n"). Needs pi_6(2^n) for all n up to 66: n <= 60 takes
  minutes, 2^61..2^63 about 4 GPU-hours, 2^64..2^66 come from the a(20) run (2^64 pending the
  discrepancy with Luhn's table).
* **New sequence: "pseudo-sextuplets"**, numbers p such that p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16 are all
  base-2 strong probable primes but not all prime. 23 terms in (10^17, 10^20) are known; [10^15, 10^16)
  has none; [0, 10^15) and (10^16, 10^17) still have to be listed (minutes on the GPU) before the
  sequence could start at its first term.
* **A200503 / A200504 / A233426**: nothing new (Desfontaines already extended A200503 to 91 terms).
* **Luhn's table**: pi_6(10^20) = 209359671771 and pi_6(2^65) = 88393273302, pi_6(2^66) = 160912739529,
  pi_6(k·10^19) (section 3) are new; pi_6(2^64) = 48629688861 would correct the table.

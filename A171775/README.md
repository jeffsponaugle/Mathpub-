# A171775 — numbers that are k-digit palindromes for every k = 2..n

Tools for computing and extending [OEIS A171775](https://oeis.org/A171775):

> a(n) = smallest number M such that there exist bases b_2, b_3, ..., b_n with the
> property that M written in base b_k is a k-digit palindrome for all k = 2..n.

The OEIS entry (Sep 2026, keywords `base,hard,more`) lists a(1..9):

```
1, 3, 5, 52, 130, 1885, 1073741824, 4398046511104, 72057594037927936
```

with a(7..9) = 2^30, 2^42, 2^56. The entry notes the bound
a(n) ≤ 2^((n-1)(n-2)) (James G. Merickel) and Max Alekseyev's conjecture (Jun 2026)
that equality holds for n ≥ 7. So the next term satisfies a(10) ≤ 2^72.

**This work: a(10) = 2^72 and a(11) = 2^90**, both new and both by exhaustive search,
confirming the conjecture for n = 10 and 11 (see Results). Neither is on the OEIS yet;
[submission.md](submission.md) has the ready-to-paste edit and the OEIS status as of
2026-10-03.

Why 2^((n-1)(n-2)) works: in base b = 2^e − 1 the number 2^r (b+1)^(L−1) has the
digits 2^r·C(L−1, j), which form an L-digit palindrome as long as every 2^r·C(L−1, j) < b.
For N = (n−1)(n−2), every length L = 2..n has a split N = e(L−1) + r that works.

## Results

### OEIS status (checked 2026-10-03)

A171775 is unchanged since revision #64 (a(9) by Max Alekseyev, approved Jun 06 2026): data
a(1..9), no pending edit or draft. Section 1 of [submission.md](submission.md) is the edit
to submit: DATA a(10)–a(11), a comment with the survivor counts, EXTENSIONS, a link to this
directory in the public repository, and optional EXAMPLE and PROG lines. Its appendix
records which of the other `src/math` submissions were live on the OEIS that day (16
approved entries) and points to the per-project `submission.md` files for what is still
open.

### a(10)

**a(10) = 2^72 = 4722366482869645213696** (new term; confirms the conjecture for n = 10).

The search was exhaustive over every M ≤ 2^72 (Sep 29 2026). It enumerated all
3.7·10¹² ten-digit palindromes in bases 2..255 and imposed the 9-digit condition in
every admissible base c. That produced 31,468,592 three-digit matches and
**135,382** numbers that are simultaneously 10-digit and 9-digit palindromes. Every
one of them except 2^72 fails at length 8: it is an 8-digit palindrome in no base.
No candidate even reached length 7.

(`scan_n10.txt`/`.log` from the M1 Pro run; the Spark logs are `cpu_n10.*` and
`cuda/gpu_n10.*` in `/home/jbs/A171775` on atom2.) The last row uses the second
method below, which enumerates the other length, so it is an algorithmically
independent confirmation of the same survivor set.

### a(11)

**a(11) = 2^90 = 1237940039285380274899124224** (new term; confirms the conjecture for n = 11).

The swapped 2D tool (see Methods) searched every M ≤ 2^90 on the M1 Pro (9 threads).
It ran Sep 29–30 2026 in three checkpointed segments totalling 10,023 s (2 h 47 min),
switching to faster binaries along the way without changing any result. It enumerated
all 7.0·10¹⁵ ten-digit palindromes in bases c ≤ 1024, did 5.39·10¹² table lookups and
1.24·10¹² two- or three-digit matches, and found **524,157** numbers that are
simultaneously 11-digit and 10-digit palindromes. Every one of them except 2^90 fails
at length 9. The single solution is 2^90, found with B = 511 and c = 1023.

(`scan_n11.txt`/`.log`/`.state`; the atom2 runs write `cpu2d_n11.*` and `cuda2d_n11.*` in
`/home/jbs/A171775`.)

Cross-method check: the 1D tool enumerates the eleven-digit palindromes instead of the
ten-digit ones. On the window [600^9, 600^9 + 3·600^8] it gives exactly the 2D tool's
result: 211 survivors, checksum 1dc0b33a97158c66 (1.15·10¹³ tuples, 3,820 s,
`cross1d_n11.*`).

The Metal port reached unit 175,527 of 523,775 (c = 594) before macOS started refusing
its command buffers ("Ignored for causing prior/excessive GPU errors", after repeated
display-watchdog kills). It is paused there (`metal/gpu_n11.state`). The tool now stops
cleanly in that situation, and the same command resumes it in a fresh process.

### Verification

* `a171775 selftest` checks a(1..6) by naive enumeration and checks that
  2^((n−1)(n−2)) passes lengths 2..n for n = 7..12. It then compares the fast filter
  with a naive scan on 400+ random blocks for n = 7..12 (B up to 511), both for full
  (n−1)-digit palindromes and for every intermediate k-digit match. Finally it
  reproduces a(7) and a(8) by full searches.
* `a171775_paranoid paranoid` is a debug build of the real search code. At every step
  it recomputes the incremental state (remainders, digits of q, w, the carry deltas)
  from scratch, and it brute-forces the innermost digit on about 1.4·10⁸ steps. This
  found and fixed one bug during development: the double-carry delta for k ≥ 3.
* a(9) = 2^56 is reproduced by an exhaustive search of [1, 2^56]: 32 s on the M1 Pro,
  19,140 (n−1)-palindromes, 1 solution.
* `verify_a171775.py brute` (pure Python, no shared code: plain enumeration, every base
  tried) gives identical statistics to the C tool on four ranges: n=7 to 2^30, n=8 to
  2^36, n=9 to 2^36, n=10 to 2^40. That covers pair counts, canonical survivors,
  checksums, failures by length and solutions.
* The CPU and GPU tools agree exactly, statistics and checksum, on n = 7, 8, 9 (full),
  on the n = 10 window [2^71, 2^71 + 2^68] (259,348,259,906 tuples, 3,792 survivors,
  checksum bf99c892387553d8), and on the full n = 10 search.

## Methods

L = 2 is free (M = "11" in base M−1). Every solution is an n-digit palindrome in some
base B and an (n−1)-digit palindrome in some base c > B. Both tools enumerate one of
those two sets and impose the other condition by solving a linear congruence for the
innermost digits, instead of trying their values.

### 1D (`a171775.c`, `cuda/a171775_cuda.cu`), used for a(10)

The tool enumerates the n-digit palindromes in base B (the smaller set for even n).

* Write M = Mblock + x·w_x + y·w_y + z·s, where x, y, z are the three innermost free
  digits of the base-B palindrome.
* Put k = n−2−⌊n/2⌋ and P = c^(⌊n/2⌋+1). As z runs over 0..B−1, M moves by less than
  P, so q = ⌊M/P⌋ (the k leading base-c digits of M) takes at most two values.
* The k trailing digits must mirror them: M ≡ T(q) (mod c^k), with T the reversed
  digits of q. That is z·s ≡ T − M0 (mod c^k).
* With g = gcd(s, c^k) and u the inverse of a unit s'' ≡ s/g (mod c^k/g), put
  w = (T − M0)·u mod c^k. A solution exists iff g | w, and the smallest one is
  z = w/g. So the per-(x, y) test is a single comparison, w < g·B.
* Stepping (x, y) changes w, M0 mod P and the digits of q by additions only. When q
  grows with the carry stopping at digit m, T moves by c^(m+1) + c^m (mod c^k).
* Hits (probability ≈ B/c^k) are checked exactly: all n−1 digits in base c.

For n = 10 this makes 5.1·10¹² (x, y, c) steps instead of about 5·10¹⁴ digit tests.

### Swapped 2D (`a171775_2d.c`, `metal/`), used for a(11)

For odd n the (n−1)-digit palindromes are the smaller set: below 2^90 there are 7.0·10¹⁵
ten-digit ones against 6.1·10¹⁶ eleven-digit ones. So this tool enumerates the
(n−1)-digit palindromes in base c and solves their two innermost digits y, z jointly
against the n-digit condition in every base B < c.

* Per base pair it uses the largest k ≤ 3 with max(span, w_x) < P = B^(n−k), where
  span = (c−1)(w_y + w_z). Then q = ⌊M/P⌋ takes at most two values over the whole
  (y, z) box, and each step of x raises it by at most one.
* The condition y·w_y + z·w_z ≡ T(q) − M1 (mod B^k) becomes, with the same gcd/unit
  transform, V(y) = (W − y·R) mod B^k with g | V and z = V/g + i·N′.
* A per-(c, B) table of y·R mod B^k, stored under the key (v mod g)·N′ + ⌊v/g⌋ and
  bucketed, turns the matching y into one short window of the table for every g. That
  is one lookup per x, or two when the box straddles q+1.
* Matches are filtered by the next digit pair: digit k comes from precomputed tables
  of (t·w_y) and (t·w_z) mod B^(k+1), and digit n−1−k from a floating-point quotient
  with an exact fallback. Only then is the full palindrome test run.

For n = 10 this needs 1.8·10¹¹ lookups, and for n = 11 about 5·10¹² (against 8.6·10¹⁶
1D steps).

Both tools keep a survivor only for the smallest bases B and c, then test each
remaining length n−2..3 by scanning its bases: last digit, a floating-point filter on
the leading digit, then an exact check. Survivor counts, the order-independent
checksum and failures-by-length mean the same thing in both tools, so their runs are
directly comparable. The file headers have the full derivations.

## Usage

```bash
make && ./a171775 selftest                     # 1D: ~4 min; 'selftest full' adds a(9)
make a171775_2d && ./a171775_2d selftest       # 2D: n = 8, 9 vs 1D stats; 'selftest full' adds n = 10
make a171775_2d_paranoid && ./a171775_2d_paranoid paranoid
./a171775_2d search 11 1 2^90 -t 9 -S scan_n11.state -i 60 > scan_n11.txt 2> scan_n11.log
./a171775 check 2^72 10
python3 verify_a171775.py brute 9 2^36
```

Metal (`make` in `metal/`; no Xcode Metal toolchain needed):

```bash
./metal/a171775_metal selftest                 # n = 8, 9, 10 vs the CPU tool's statistics
./metal/a171775_metal search 11 1 2^90 -S metal/gpu_n11.state -i 120 > metal/gpu_n11.txt 2> metal/gpu_n11.log
```

On the Spark (nvcc is `/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc`; `make` in `cuda/`):

```bash
./a171775_cuda selftest                        # a(7), a(8), a(9) + CPU-tool statistics
./a171775_cuda search 10 1 2^72 -S gpu_n10.state -i 30 > gpu_n10.txt 2> gpu_n10.log
./a171775_2d_cuda selftest                     # 2D: n = 8, 9, 10 vs the CPU tool's statistics
./a171775_2d_cuda search 11 1 2^90 -S cuda2d_n11.state -i 60 > cuda2d_n11.txt 2> cuda2d_n11.log
```

`a171775_2d.c` compiles as C or C++. The Metal and CUDA hosts include it with
`A171775_2D_LIB` (no `main`), and the CUDA one also sets `A171775_2D_NO_DRIVER` (no C11
thread driver), so all three tools share the tables, survivor logic and state files.

Searches are checkpointed with `-S`: the state file stores the frontier unit and the
statistics, and rerunning the same command resumes. The 2D CPU and Metal tools share
the state-file format and the unit numbering. `-E u` stops at unit u, and
`a171775_2d -u n c HI` prints the first unit of base c; together they allow exact
comparisons of slices. After SIGINT the tools finish their units in flight and save a
consistent checkpoint. Solutions go to stdout, progress to stderr.

## Performance notes

* M1 Pro CPU (9 threads): about 6.5–7·10⁸ lookups/s with the 2D tool on n = 11.
* M1 Pro GPU (Metal, 16 cores): the tool gives identical results, but on this
  workload it is only about CPU speed. Its state updates run at 10¹⁰ steps/s, but the
  table lookups and candidate checks are data-dependent and irregular, so the SIMD
  lanes diverge. It is fastest at small c, where lookups have few matches, and slow at
  large c, where most base pairs have k = 2 and many matches. Long command buffers
  trigger the display watchdog ("Impacting Interactivity"); the tool keeps batches
  short and retries a killed batch with smaller ones.
* DGX Spark GB10 (CUDA, 1D kernel): 3.3·10¹⁰ steps/s while sharing the GPU with
  another job; a(10) took 154 s.
* DGX Spark (2D tool, n = 11): 16 CPU threads give about 1.35·10⁹ lookups/s and did
  a(11) in 4,474 s. The GB10 with the CUDA port did it in 3,411 s. It is about
  6·10⁹ lookups/s at small c and slower than the CPU threads at large c, where most
  pairs have k = 2 and the lookups diverge; the 20-unit c = 600 test slice took 10.5 s
  against 2.4 s. Kernels there run up to 50 s, which is fine on the Spark.

## Outlook: a(12)

The conjectured value is 2^110 ≈ 1.3·10³³. 2^90 is not a 12-digit palindrome
(`a171775 check 2^90 12`), so a(12) > 2^90, but that is only the trivial bound
a(12) ≥ a(11). For even n the n-digit palindromes are the smaller set: about 7·10¹⁸
twelve-digit palindromes lie below 2^110. So a search would use the 2D lookup in the
original orientation, solving two base-B digits against the 11-digit condition, and
needs about 1.4·10¹⁶ lookups. At the GB10 rate of the a(11) run (1.6·10⁹ lookups/s)
that is about 100 GPU-days, or two months on both Sparks. The 96-bit limbs would have
to grow, because M reaches 2^110. Not attempted.

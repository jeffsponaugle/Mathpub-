# A137723 — runs of numbers with a prime gap in their factorization

Tool for computing and extending [OEIS A137723](https://oeis.org/A137723):

> First occurrence of a set of n consecutive numbers having at least one prime
> gap in their factorization: a(n) = smallest number of this set.

A number has a *prime gap in its factorization* (A073490 > 0) when its distinct
prime factors are not consecutive primes: 10 = 2·5 skips 3, 84 = 2²·3·7 skips 5.
Numbers **without** a gap (A073491, "gap-free" below) are 1, the primes, prime
powers, and products of consecutive primes with any exponents: 12 = 2²·3,
35 = 5·7, 2940 = 2²·3·5·7², 65536 = 2¹⁶.

If g < g' are consecutive gap-free numbers, then g+1 .. g'−1 is a maximal run of
n = g'−g−1 numbers that all have a gap, and a(n) is the smallest g+1 over all
runs of length exactly n. Example: 83 and 89 are consecutive gap-free numbers
and 84..88 all have gaps, so a(5) = 84.

The OEIS entry (Sep 2026) lists a(1..31) and notes a(32) > 10¹¹.

## Results

Everything below was computed with this tool on an Apple M1 Pro (10 cores) and
the new terms were verified independently with `verify_run.py` (pure Python:
its own Miller–Rabin and Pollard rho) and, for the prime endpoints, `openssl prime`.

**The sequence is now known for n = 1..193** (the OEIS entry stops at a(31)).
`b137723.txt` is the b-file and `DATA.txt` the OEIS DATA line; both are produced by `make_bfile.py`.
The first 61 terms:

```
10, 33, 20, 55, 84, 114, 390, 513, 182, 200, 468, 2941, 774, 65522, 1832, 1261, 1130, 1332, 1638, 524289, 1952, 4298, 4524, 69960, 5120, 16385, 2972, 4832, 5352, 10801, 5592, 18014398509481952, 8468, 1119745, 9552, 69264, 39462, 33554394, 20810, 74960, 38502, 107521, 15684, 274877906900, 81464, 214994, 28230, 124368, 31908, 2417851639229258349412302, 19610, 748388, 35618, 306109962, 82074, 268435400, 44294, 360092, 43332, 2799300, 34062
```

followed by a(62) = 23384026197294446691258957323460528314494920687554 = 2¹⁶⁴ − 62 (50 digits),
a(63) = 87494, and so on; 38 of the 193 terms exceed 10¹¹, the largest being
a(176) = 2³⁷² − 176 with 112 digits.

The terms the exhaustive scan could not reach were found by the structural
search, every one of them adjacent to a power of two:

(a(94), a(114) = 2³⁶·3⁵ + 1, a(124), a(132), a(154) and a few others in
`next_1e11.txt` are adjacent to other even gap-free numbers such as 2²⁹·3¹⁰ or
2²⁴·3²⁸; they are the cases where d has no factor 3 — for a(154), d = 155 = 5·31
lets E = 2^a·3^b have a prime partner.) Every a(n) with n ≡ 2 (mod 6) found so
far is adjacent to a power of two, as step 3 of "How it works" predicts.

**Open cases.** a(194) is the first unknown term (d = 195 = 3·5·13: block
{3, 5}, so the even endpoint is enumerated up to k = 3 — about 45 million
candidates below 2¹⁰⁰⁰, a few minutes). After it the unknown even n are 200,
204, 206, 212, 214, 218, 224, … (the scan to 10¹¹ knows every odd n up to 463). Most of them are cheap in GMP mode; the tool prints the estimated
enumeration size before starting.
The complete table for n ≤ 463 is in `next_1e11.txt`; `search_2e127.txt` holds
the 2¹²⁷ searches.

### The a(32) run in detail

`./a137723 run 2^54-32` prints the whole run. Consecutive primes are joined
with `*`; a ` | ` marks a prime gap, i.e. every prime strictly between the two
neighbours is missing from the factorization (`2^5 | 127` skips 3, 5, 7, …, 113).

```

Observations:

* Every one of the 32 numbers has at least one gap (A073490 ≥ 1). The smallest
  count is 1 — for instance 18014398509481961 = 5029469 · 3581769469 and
  18014398509481973 = 43 · 418939500220511 — and the largest is 7, for
  18014398509481959 = 3 · 13 · 41 · 83 · 167 · 211 · 293 · 13147.
* Only three numbers contain a block of consecutive primes at all: 5·7² in
  …955, 2·3 in …962 and 2²·3·5 in …980 (plus the pure powers 2⁵, 3⁴ and 17²).
  Everything else jumps straight from its smallest prime to a much larger one.
* The bounds are the interesting part. The run ends at 2⁵⁴, a pure power of two
  and therefore gap-free, and it starts right after the prime 2⁵⁴ − 33. The
  sixteen odd numbers in between are all composite, so the run is really a
  prime gap of 33 sitting directly below 2⁵⁴ with no prime power or
  consecutive-prime product inside it. As explained below, that is essentially
  the only way a run of length 32 can arise, which is why a(32) ≈ 1.8·10¹⁶
  while a(31) = 5592 and a(33) = 8468.

## Building

Requires [primesieve](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve)
(`brew install primesieve`) and a C11 compiler with `unsigned __int128`.
[GMP](https://gmplib.org) (`brew install gmp`) is optional; the Makefile
detects it and enables `search -l` above 2¹²⁷.

```bash
make            # builds ./a137723
make test       # runs the self-test (about half a second)
```

## Usage

```
a137723 scan N [-t T] [-m MAXN] [-o FILE]     exhaustive: every a(n) <= N
a137723 search n [n ...] [-l LIMIT] [-t T]    structural search for even n (default LIMIT 2^64);
                                              LIMIT above 2^127 (e.g. 2^1000) uses GMP, --gmp forces it,
                                              --max-nodes X caps the estimated enumeration (default 5e9)
a137723 next [-N SCAN] [-l LIMIT] [-t T] [-m MAXN] [-o FILE]
                                              scan to SCAN (default 10^10), then search the missing even n
a137723 check m                               factor m and count its prime gaps (A073490)
a137723 run m                                 show the maximal run of gapful numbers around m
                                              (both accept numbers above 2^128 when built with GMP)
a137723 selftest [-t T]
```

Numbers may be written as decimal, `2^k`, `10^k`, `1e15`, or sums/differences
such as `2^54-32`. `-t` defaults to the number of CPUs.

Examples:

```bash
./a137723 scan 10^11                 # reproduces a(1..31), confirms a(32) > 10^11 (about 3 s on 10 cores)
./a137723 search 32 -l 2^127         # a(32) in a quarter of a second
./a137723 search 74 104 116 -l 2^127   # hard cases in 128-bit mode, seconds to minutes each
./a137723 search 62 -l 2^1000          # GMP mode: a(62) = 2^164-62 in half a second
./a137723 search 194 200 204 -l 2^1000 # next open terms
./a137723 run 2^54-32                # print the 32 factorizations of the a(32) run
./a137723 run 2^223+1                # the a(188) run, 68-digit numbers (GMP)
./a137723 check 2940                 # 2^2*3*5*7^2, no gap
python3 verify_run.py 18014398509481951 18014398509481984   # independent check of a run
```

## How it works: the search technique

Two very different engines are combined. The **exhaustive scan** is the
ground truth: it finds every a(n) below its limit N and proves that anything
it did not find is larger than N. The **structural search** covers the even n
whose first run lies far beyond any feasible scan, by exploiting a parity
argument that pins one end of the run to a very restricted set of numbers.

### 1. Reformulating the problem

The definition talks about runs of consecutive integers with a prime gap in
their factorization. It is easier to look at their complement. Call a number
*gap-free* if its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes (A073491):
1, every prime, every prime power, and products such as 2²·3, 5·7, 2·3·5·7,
2⁴·3³·5². Then

    g < g' consecutive gap-free numbers  <=>  g+1 .. g'-1 is a maximal run of n = g'-g-1 gapful numbers

and a(n) is simply g+1 for the smallest such pair with g'−g = n+1. So the
whole problem is about *differences between consecutive gap-free numbers*,
exactly like prime gaps are differences between consecutive primes — and
since almost all gap-free numbers are primes, the two problems are close
cousins: a(n) for odd n is usually just the start of the first prime gap of
size n+1 (a(31) = 5592 comes from the prime gap 5591 → 5623), unless a prime
power or a consecutive-prime product happens to fall inside that gap (the
first prime gap of 34, 1327 → 1361, is spoiled by 1331 = 11³ and
1350 = 2·3³·5², which is why a(33) = 8468 instead of 1328).

### 2. `scan`: exhaustive enumeration of gap-free numbers

Gap-free numbers are sparse: about N/ln N primes plus O(√N) composites (a
composite gap-free number has smallest prime p ≤ √N, since it is at least p²).
Rather than factoring every integer up to N, the scan generates the gap-free
numbers directly and reads off the differences:

* primes come from a `primesieve_iterator` — one iterator per thread;
* composite gap-free numbers are enumerated recursively: for each prime
  p ≤ √N take p^e (e ≥ 2), then optionally multiply by powers of the next
  prime, then the next, and so on while the product stays below N. There are
  only 17131 of them below 10⁹, 91043 below 10¹¹ and about half a million
  below 10¹³; they are sorted once and shared read-only by all threads.

Worker threads take fixed-size chunks of [1, N] from an atomic counter, merge
the prime stream with the composite list, and record the first occurrence of
every difference n = g'−g−1. The pair (g, g') belongs to the thread whose chunk
contains g, and each thread simply keeps iterating past its chunk end until it
has seen the first gap-free number beyond it, so chunk boundaries need no
special handling. primesieve is fast enough that a scan to 10¹¹ takes about
3 s on ten cores; the bound "a(32) > 10¹¹" from the OEIS entry is reproduced
in that time, and the scan is what produced every odd-n term.

### 3. `search`: structural search for even n

The scan cannot reach a(32) ≈ 1.8·10¹⁶ (that would be about 10⁵ times more
work than 10¹¹). The structural search gets there in a quarter of a second by
throwing away almost all candidates before looking at them.

**Step 1 — parity.** For even n, d = n+1 is odd, so the two bounding gap-free
numbers L and R = L + d have different parity: exactly one of them is even.

**Step 2 — the shape of even gap-free numbers.** An even gap-free number
contains the prime 2, and its primes must be consecutive starting from 2, so
it is necessarily

    E = 2^e1 · 3^e2 · 5^e3 · … · p_k^ek     (the first k primes, every exponent ≥ 1).

These numbers are extremely sparse: about 2.5 million below 2⁶⁴ and 1.7·10¹⁰
below 2¹²⁷ (compare with 1.7·10³⁸ integers). Enumerating all of them is cheap,
and for each E only two partners have to be examined, O = E + d and O = E − d.
If O is gap-free and the numbers strictly between E and O all have a gap, then
(min, max) is a valid pair. Since every possible even endpoint is visited, the
search is **exhaustive** for L ≤ limit − d: the smallest hit is a(n), and if
there is no hit then a(n) > limit − d + 1. This is a proof, not a heuristic.

**Step 3 — propagating the constraints of d.** The odd partner O = E ± d is
tightly constrained by the primes that E and d share:

* if p | E and p | d then p | O;
* if p | E and p ∤ d then p ∤ O.

Because O's prime factors must themselves be consecutive, the odd primes ≤ p_k
that divide d must form a contiguous block of consecutive primes — otherwise no
E with k primes can work at all, which caps k (`kmax` in the program). And O can
be *prime* only if no odd prime ≤ p_k divides d (`kprime`). Worked example for
n = 32, d = 33 = 3·11:

* k = 1, E = 2^a: no constraint; O = 2^a ± 33 may be prime, a prime power, or
  a product of consecutive primes ≥ 5.
* k = 2, E = 2^a·3^b: 3 | O, so O = 3^x·5^y·7^z·… (a product starting at 3).
* k = 3, 4 (E also contains 5, or 5 and 7): 3 | O but 5 ∤ O, so O must be a pure
  power of 3.
* k ≥ 5 (E contains 11): 3 | O and 11 | O but 5 ∤ O — impossible for a gap-free
  number. So `kmax` = 4.

Hence a run of exactly 32 with a *prime* endpoint must sit right next to a
power of two, and the only alternatives are the astronomically rare
coincidences 2^a·3^b·… ± 33 = 3^x·5^y·… . With only 36 powers of two below
10¹¹, and each 2^a having perhaps a 1–2 % chance of having 2^a ± 33 prime with
no other prime in between, it is no surprise that nothing exists below 10¹¹; the
first success is 2⁵⁴ − 33. The same argument applies whenever 3 | n+1, i.e. for
every n ≡ 2 (mod 6): 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, …, and indeed every such term
found is adjacent to a power of two. For other even n more shapes of E are
allowed — for d = 35 = 5·7 both 2^a and 2^a·3^b may have prime partners — and
those terms are correspondingly smaller (a(34) = 1119745 = 2⁹·3⁷ + 1).

For odd n no such parity trick exists: both endpoints are odd and usually
both prime, so the even-endpoint enumeration cannot be exhaustive and the tool
refuses odd n in `search`. Those terms are small anyway and come from `scan`.

**Step 4 — the gap-free test.** Deciding whether an arbitrary 128-bit O is
gap-free would normally mean factoring it, but the structure of gap-free numbers
makes it cheap:

* trial division by the primes below 2¹⁶; as soon as the smallest prime p is
  found, divide out p, then the *next* prime, then the next … the number is
  gap-free iff this chain reaches 1. Almost all candidates die within a few
  divisions (e.g. 3 | O but 5 ∤ O with a cofactor left);
* if there is no factor below 2¹⁶: a Miller–Rabin test (deterministic bases
  below 2⁶⁴, 24 bases above) — a prime is gap-free;
* otherwise O is composite with all prime factors above 2¹⁶. If it were
  gap-free with t prime factors (counted with multiplicity), its primes would be
  consecutive and nearly equal, so its smallest prime p₁ satisfies
  p₁ < O^(1/t) < p_s: p₁ is one of the t−1 largest primes below the integer
  t-th root. For each t with (2¹⁶)^t < O (t ≤ 7 for 128-bit numbers) those few
  candidates are generated with prev-prime steps and checked with the chain
  division above. No general factoring is ever needed.

The interior check (are the n numbers between E and O all gapful?) uses the
same routine and is only run when O passed, which is rare.

**Step 5 — parallelism and arithmetic.** The enumeration is a depth-first
walk over exponent vectors. The top three levels (2^a, 2^a·3^b, 2^a·3^b·5^c)
are materialised as a task list — about 12 000 tasks up to 2⁶⁴ and 93 000 up to
2¹²⁷ — and worker threads pull tasks from an atomic counter, recursing into
7, 11, 13, … themselves; the biggest subtrees come first, so the load balances
well. All values are `unsigned __int128`; modular multiplication above 2⁶⁴ is
a plain shift-and-add, which is slow (~0.5 µs) but only reached for the handful
of candidates without small factors. The enumeration runs at roughly 50 million
E per second on ten cores, so a fully unconstrained case (`kmax` = ∞, 1.7·10¹⁰
even gap-free numbers below 2¹²⁷) takes about six minutes and a constrained one
like d = 33 (k ≤ 4, about a million E) a fraction of a second.

**Step 6 — beyond 128 bits (GMP mode).** Above 2¹²⁷ the same theorem is
applied more selectively, because enumerating *every* even gap-free number is
no longer an option (there are ~10¹⁴ of them below 2¹⁰⁰⁰). Let p_j be the
smallest odd prime dividing d and {p_j, …, p_m} the maximal block of
consecutive primes starting at p_j that all divide d. For an even endpoint
with k primes the odd partner O = E ± d is

* coprime to the first k primes when k < j — it may be prime, so E has to be
  enumerated;
* a product over {p_j, …, p_k} times an optional consecutive continuation when
  j ≤ k ≤ m — open-ended, so again E is enumerated;
* **exactly** a product over the fixed set {p_j, …, p_m} when k > m — so for
  those k the program enumerates O instead, which is a tiny set (the powers of
  3 when the block is just {3}), and checks whether O ± d is an even gap-free
  number with more than m primes.

For the blockers d = 63, 123, 153 the block is {3}, so the whole search is the
line 2^a ± d plus 2^a·3^b ± d plus the powers of 3: about 316 000 candidates
below 2¹⁰⁰⁰, half a second on ten cores, most of it Miller–Rabin tests on the
2^a ± d values. The gap-free test is the same trial division / probable-prime /
t-th-root routine written with `mpz_t`; below 2¹²⁷ it falls back to the 128-bit
code. The program prints the estimated enumeration size before starting and
refuses if it exceeds `--max-nodes`. What remains expensive is a d whose block
of small prime factors is long: for d = 105 = 3·5·7 the E side runs to k = 3
(45 million candidates below 2¹⁰⁰⁰, minutes) and for d = 245 = 5·7² to k = 4
(4·10⁹, so choose a lower limit such as 2⁴⁰⁰).

**Limits.** Everything is exhaustive only up to the chosen limit, and the
enumeration size grows like (ln limit)^m, so a large block of small prime
factors in d is the one thing that keeps a term out of reach. Primality above
2⁶⁴ is probabilistic; see "Verification".

## Verification

* `selftest` compares the gap-free test against brute-force factorization for
  every m ≤ 2·10⁶, compares the multithreaded scan against a brute-force scan and
  against all 31 OEIS terms, checks the primality code against known primes and
  strong pseudoprimes (including 128-bit ones), exercises the root trick on
  products of consecutive primes near 2³², 2⁴¹ and 2⁶², reproduces every even
  OEIS term with the structural search, and compares the structural search with
  the exhaustive scan for all 76 even run lengths occurring below 10⁷.
* `search` re-checks the reported minimum with a completely separate full
  factorization (trial division + Pollard–Brent rho + Miller–Rabin). For runs
  above 2¹⁰⁰ or so this can report INCOMPLETE when rho cannot split some
  interior number in its budget (it happened for a(146) and a(164)); that is a
  limitation of the display factorizer, not of the search.
* `verify_run.py L R` is an independent pure-Python check of any run. Its
  verdict never needs a complete factorization: a number with no prime factor
  below 10⁵ is gap-free only if it is prime or a product of a few nearly equal
  consecutive primes, which the t-th-root test settles with a handful of
  primality tests. It certified every term listed above, including a(146) and
  a(164), in about 10 s each.

Primality above 2⁶⁴ is a strong probable-prime test (24 bases in the 128-bit
code, 30 rounds of `mpz_probab_prime_p` in GMP mode); before submitting a term
whose endpoints exceed 2⁶⁴ to the OEIS, certify the prime endpoint with PARI/GP
`isprime` or similar. The a(32) and a(44) endpoints are below 2⁶⁴, where the
test is deterministic. The prime endpoints of a(62), a(122) and a(152)
(2¹⁶⁴ − 63, 2²⁹⁷ − 123, 2¹⁴⁶ − 153), a(154), a(176), a(182) and a(188) were
re-checked with `verify_run.py` (and, for the first three, `openssl prime`).
